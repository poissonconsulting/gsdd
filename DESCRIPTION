Description: Calculates Growing Season Degree Days (GSDD), Growing Degree
    Days (GDD) and the Growing Seasons (GSS) from water temperature data.
    GSSD is a water temperature metric that is a useful predictor of 
    age-0 trout size at the beginning of winter. 
    It is the accumulated thermal units (in C) 
    during the growing season based on the mean daily water temperature values.
    GDD is the GSSD to a particular date.
