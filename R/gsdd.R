#' Calculate Growing Season Degree Days (GSDD)
#' 
#' Growing Season Degree Days (GSDD) is a water temperature metric
#' that is a useful predictor of Cutthroat trout size at the
#' beginning of winter. 
#' It is the accumulated thermal units (in C) 
#' during the growing season based on the mean daily water temperature values.
#' 
#' The GSDD is calculated across the longest consecutive sequence of non-missing
#' values which must be at least twice the window width in length otherwise a 
#' missing value is returned.
#' If the vector includes missing values it is recommended that they are
#' replaced by estimates of the actual values.
#'
#' The default values and implementation of the 
#' growing season are based on
#' Coleman and Fausch (2007) who stated that
#'
#' We defined the start of the growing season as the
#' beginning of the first week that average stream temperatures exceeded and
#' remained above 5C for the season;
#' the end of the growing season was defined as
#' the last day of the first week that
#' average stream temperature dropped below 4C.
#'
#' For the purposes of the calculation week is assumed to refer to a seven day
#' rolling average as opposed to the calendar week.
#' 
#' If there are multiple growing 'seasons' within the same year then by
#' default the returned value is the sum of the GSDD values for `"all"` seasons.
#' 
#' The user also has the option to pick the `"first"`/`"last"` or
#'  `"longest"`/`"shortest"` season or the season with 
#'  the `"biggest"`/`"smallest"` GSDD.
#'  If the user picks the `"longest"` season but there are multiple seasons
#' with the longest length then the candidate 
#' season with the `"biggest"` GSDD is selected.
#' Conversely in the case of multiple `"shortest"` seasons then the
#' candidate with the `"smallest"` GSDD is selected.
#' 
#' Truncation occurs when the start and/or end
#' of the time series is part way through a growing season.
#' If the user chooses to ignore truncation then the returned value
#' very likely to be less than the actual GSDD.
